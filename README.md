# Implementation-and-Analysis-of-BPSK-Using-EMONA-and-MATLAB-Simulink
This project focuses on BPSK implementation using the EMONA board and MATLAB Simulink. We performed the hardware experiment, captured waveforms, and recreated the same setup in Simulink with matching parameters. The project helped us understand BPSK both practically and through simulation.
